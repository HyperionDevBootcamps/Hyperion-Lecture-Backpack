# Lecture directories
Directories containing leture content for the Modern Development Practices series.

Please refer to the lecture title when looking for the relevant directory.

- E.g. If your lecture title is "Git" the content for this lecture will be in the directory named "Git".

Please note the content for both **Django** lectures are in the same folder, as well as the content for both **Docker** lectures, as the same projects were used for demonstration.
