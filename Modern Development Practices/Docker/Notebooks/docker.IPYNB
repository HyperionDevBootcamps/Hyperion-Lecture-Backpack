    "    - Containers provide process and resource isolation, ensuring that applications and their dependencies do not interfere with each other. \n",
    "- **Portability:**\n",
    "    - Containers encapsulate the entire runtime environment, including the application code and dependencies making it easy to move between environments. \n",
    "- **Consistency:**\n",
    "    - Containers ensure that applications run consistently across different systems and platforms.\n",
    "- **Resource Efficiency:**\n",
    "    - Containers share the same host operating system kernel, which makes them lightweight compared to traditional virtual machines (VMs).\n",

    "Containerization has revolutionized software development and deployment by providing a consistent, efficient, and flexible way to package and run applications, making it a fundamental technology in modern IT landscapes."
